# Bindings for completing the current line in the history of previous
# commands. This allows you to recall any previous command by typing its first
# few letters and hitting Control-p, bypassing all intermediate commands which
# may be in the history (much faster than hitting up-arrow 50 times!)
#"\C-p": history-search-backward
#"\C-n": history-search-forward

# I also like to have the same functionality on the plain arrow keys. If you'd
# rather have the arrows use all the history (and not just match what you've
# typed so far), comment out or delete the next two lines.
